# Automatic Speech Processing

This repository is for working on the [`Automatic Speech Processing`](https://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/automatic-speech-processing-EE-554) course I am (currently) completing at EPFL.

This repository will include (among other files) the notes I take during lectures, the slides of the lectures, as well as the lab notebooks we complete as exercises for the course.
